<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/XFzYdB6/reusable-button-component-netlify-app.png)

My first attempt was really bad, I tried to use CSS, but the file was getting too long, and if I would like to add more color It would be a pain, then I discovered the Styled Components library, which allows me to use the javascript logic with CSS that's why you can use any color to the button, not just specific ones.

I still think that had a lot of issues with the code inside of my Styled Components, which I hope to improve in the next ones.
